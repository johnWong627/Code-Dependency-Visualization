# Code-Dependency-Visualization
This tool analyzes code dependencies, building upper and lower layer call graphs for components. It supports Python, Java. Using a DFS algorithm, it scans files, parses code via AST or regex, and stores dependencies in a Neo4j graph database. The tool also offers a visualization interface using tkinter and pyvis to display component maps
